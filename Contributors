“Mom, What’s for Dinner?” Project Contributors

As a team of three, we worked to design a project that suggests a specific food to the users.
Team members consist of Burcu Bilgin, Buse Erkiraz and Can Kalender. All members
actively participated in the brainstorming process to come up with a plausible project idea.
The project management and development was done collaboratively most of the time. Along
with that, our team has divided into natural project roles:

Data Collector & Modeler: Can Kalender
What can you suggest without having a dataset? After searching as a team for an extensive
food recipe dataset to use in our project, Can found a dataset on Kaggle.com, which
consists of over 180 thousand recipes from different cuisines in the world. In addition, he
analyzed whether the data is diverse enough in terms of a compassive representation of the
world cuisines and dietary types.

Coder: Burcu Bilgin
Obviously, no coding means no NLP project. Burcu has written nearly all of the code from
installation of necessary libraries to the final output of the program. She implemented the
model we’ve used, defined necessary functions such as cosine similarity and jaccard
distance, and implemented Bloom filters. She successfully obtained an output from the
program and used it to measure the success of our project.

Code Cleaner & User-Friendly Outlook: Buse Erkiraz
Trying to expect food suggestions in a messy code would even make someone even
hungrier. Buse was there to clean the dataset entries using RegEx. Our data involves lots of
noise from double spaces, quotation marks to square brackets. She has written RegEx
codes to clean up the messy data and give the overall code a better look.
